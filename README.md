This is a fan game for Portal that me and some other friends are actively working on!
Right now its in like pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha state because I am bad at game development.

This is not made in Source. If I wanted to build it in Source I would have just made a Portal 2 mod.

| Game Engine | Used|
| -------     | ----|
| Source 2010 | ✖️|
|  Unity      | ✅|

Do not be mistaken. As I said above, this is NOT a Source 2010 or Source 2009.9, or Source 2009.8, or Source 2001.3924502359235824959353495934, or Source 2004 game. It is built in Unity.

This will also not get a Steam release.
